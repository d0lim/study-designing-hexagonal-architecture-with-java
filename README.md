# Designing Hexagonal Architecture with Java Study Repository

## What is this repository for?

- This repository has example code for the
  book [Designing Hexagonal Architecture with Java](https://www.packtpub.com/product/designing-hexagonal-architecture-with-java-and-quarkus/9781801816489?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801816489).
- Original code example repository
  is [here](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Designing-Hexagonal-Architecture-with-Java).

## Difference between original code example

- I am writing the whole code with Kotlin.
- I am using [Kotest](https://kotest.io) for BDD specification, while original code
  uses [Cucumber](https://cucumber.io).
- I am using Hibernate instead of EclipseLink. Which is the more common implementation for JPA.
- Failed to run the ch04 rest adapter with h2 database. Any helps are welcome.
